Playwright API Automation Portfolio

Welcome to my API Automation Testing Framework built with Playwright.
This project demonstrates my ability to design scalable, maintainable, and client-ready API test frameworks.

âœ¨ Features of This Framework

âœ… Playwright API Testing â€“ End-to-end API automation with Playwrightâ€™s APIRequestContext
âœ… Reusable Base API Layer â€“ All API methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) in one place
âœ… Modular API Clients â€“ Dedicated API classes for JSONPlaceholder & DummyJSON
âœ… Fixtures for API Clients â€“ Easy injection of API objects into tests
âœ… Authentication Handling â€“ Example of login + token usage (DummyJSON)
âœ… Chained API Flows â€“ Realistic test flows (Auth â†’ CRUD â†’ Search)
âœ… Test Data Management â€“ Centralized testData.ts for reusability
âœ… Standardized Messages & Status Codes â€“ Improves readability & maintainability
âœ… Scalable Folder Structure â€“ Industry-standard separation of concerns
âœ… Tagging Support (@smoke, @regression) â€“ Run targeted test sets easily
