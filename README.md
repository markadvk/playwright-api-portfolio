# 🚀 Playwright API Test Automation Framework

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](./LICENSE)

A **robust**, **scalable**, and **modular** API automation framework built using `Playwright` and `TypeScript`.  
Designed for **freelance projects** and **real-world production APIs**, it follows industry best practices with a clean architecture, reusable API clients, and flexible test execution.

---

## 🔑 Key Features
- Built with `Playwright` + `TypeScript` using **APIRequestContext**
- Clean, modular folder structure with clear **naming conventions**
- Dedicated **Base API Layer** with reusable `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`
- Supports multiple test types: `@smoke`, `@regression`
- **Chained API Flows** (Auth → CRUD → Search) for real-world coverage
- Centralized **test data**, **messages**, and **status codes**
- **Fixtures** for easy API client injection into tests
- Fully **configurable headers** & token-based authentication
- Auto-generates **HTML reports** with Playwright
- Simple execution via pre-defined `npm` commands

## 📁 Folder Structure Overview
Organized for modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance — following best practices for Playwright API automation.

## 🧪 Test Case Naming Standard
Format: @tag TC-ID should <action>

Example:
```bash
test('@smoke TC-001 should create a new user successfully', async ({ jsonUsersApi }) => { ... });
```
This ensures test cases are traceable, action-focused, and client-friendly.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Details
- baseURL: Configurable per environment (DummyJSON, JSONPlaceholder, etc.)
- headers.ts: Dynamically injects auth tokens and common headers
- fixtures.ts: Provides ready-to-use API clients in tests
- video, screenshot: Available if combined with UI + API flows
- Tagging supported → run targeted test sets easily

---

## 📦 Available NPM Scripts
```bash
Command	Description
npm run test	            Run all tests in headless mode
npm run test:smoke	      Run only tests tagged with @smoke
npm run test:regression	  Run only tests tagged with @regression
```
All scripts are pre-configured in package.json for client convenience.

---

## 🧭 Coding Best Practices Followed
- No hardcoded values — all data comes from testData.ts
- Reusable methods across API clients via BaseApi
- Fixtures inject APIs instead of new everywhere
- Consistent naming conventions for files & tests
- .gitignore pre-configured to avoid clutter (node_modules, logs, reports)

---

## 🧩 Sample Features Covered
- Authentication (DummyJSON login + token usage)
- CRUD operations on users (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Chained flows → Login → Create User → Update → Delete → Search
- JSONPlaceholder users API → Example of CRUD coverage
- Status codes & message validations

---

## 📊 Test Reports
- Rich HTML report auto-generated by Playwright under /playwright-report
- Each test includes logs, steps, and traces
- Can be extended to JUnit/JSON reporters for CI/CD pipelines

---

## Features:
- Structured CRUD & Auth test coverage
- Status, Priority, and Execution filters
- Auto-calculated metrics + visual dashboard

---

## 🤝 What I Can Offer Clients
- Build API automation frameworks from scratch with Playwright
- Convert Postman collections into maintainable automated tests
- Integrate API tests into CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)
- Add both UI + API hybrid testing for full E2E coverage
- Deliver production-ready, scalable automation suites

---

## 🌐 Demo APIs Used
This framework demonstrates API testing on:

- 🔗 DummyJSON → https://dummyjson.com (Auth, CRUD, Search)

- 🔗 JSONPlaceholder → https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com (Mock CRUD APIs)

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This framework is battle-tested, highly maintainable, and ready to scale.
It’s ideal for clients seeking professional-grade API automation with clean code, modular design, and full test coverage.
